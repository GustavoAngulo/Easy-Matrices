# Easy Matrices

## About
Easy Matrices is an interactive teaching module so that kids can learn the fundamentals of matrices through lessons, and be able to visually create and work with matrices in the workspace. The project is made entirely in Python 3, using Tkinter for graphics and Numpy for calculations. The project is built on OOP by allowing the user to create matrix or number objects, and manipulating those.
